								<h3>Summary of program</h3>

									<p>The goals of the program was to  Introduce basic practical computer knowledge to all students in the Dalun Community including any member of the community who wished to learn more about the use of Computers. Since the schools in Dalun teach the theoretical aspect of ICT. My teammate and i aimed at reinforcing the lessons taught by using computers. Our last goal was to create a website to help people learn more about the only ICT centre in Dalun and have updates on events at the centre. 
									</p>
									<h4>Structure of internship: </h4>
									
										<p>The (Information Communication and Technology) ICT internship's responsibilities included  coordinating and maintaining the equipments and computers of the ICT centre. I prepared for lessons in the morning by getting materials and computers up and running for a smooth operation of the centre.
										My teammate and i started our internship by visiting schools in the Dalun Community. We informed them that the centre was going to offer free introduction to computer skills  and the students were invited given that they do Computer theory lessons at their schools.  We required the schools to bring 18 Students to the centre because the centre only has 18 Desktop computers. 
										</p>
									<h5>Accomplishments:	</h4>

									<p>I managed to help introduce basic computer skills to over 500 students in the community in 7 weeks making the students in the Dalun Community of Ghana computer literate. I hosted a workshop on 22nd of July 2019 for the students and the workshop included learning about the Microsoft tools, and public speaking. The objective of the showcase was to impact the children to think more about computers and solidify the lessons they learnt through out the program. The other objective was to encourage them to learn and practice the use of Computers.

								<h2>Google Applied Computer Science skills</h2>

<p>As our final project for the Google J-Term / Applied CS program, we decided to create an app to facilitate Bryn Mawr students' requests for Lantern Van rides around campus and select off-campus locations. The Lantern Van is a service where a student driver will pick students up and drop them off at desired locations.
    Our final project supports functionality for choosing pickup and dropoff locations, and for displaying both locations on the map.</p>

<h3>Inspiration & Objectives</h3>

<p>When Bryn Mawr students call to request a ride, they usually have to wait a long time, do not know where the Lantern Van is, and find it to be an inconvenient process.
 By creating Lantern Request, we wanted to create an app where students can request rides more conveniently, get real-time updates of where the Lantern Van is, how long they have to wait before the Lantern Van to arrives at their pickup location, and add multiple pickup and dropoff locations.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<p>Since we are a team of four students, we decided to do some pair programming. The dropdown menus for the current default page of the app on one screen and being able to store the pickup and dropoff locations was on one computer, which was to be merged with the code for setting the markers for the selected pickup and dropoff locations on the map using the Google Maps API. There were some subtle differences in some of the project files on the two computers, so merging took much more time than originally anticipated to stop the app from crashing.
A challenge that was much easier to be resolved was figuring out how to implement the Google Maps API. While we were originally using a MapView object in Android Studio, we found, through the documentation, that using a GoogleMap object and an API key would help us display the map we wanted on the screen.
A challenge we hoped to resolve was being able to support ride requests with multiple passengers. Since the Lantern Van can hold up to four passengers, we would have liked to have the user be able to specify the number of passengers for their ride instead of defaulting to one passenger per request.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>-Enhance the app so that a single request can be made for 1, 2, 3, or 4 passengers. Manage time slots and figure out a more realistic waiting time. Adjust the size of the map for a better UI experience. Make an iOS version of the app. Make the app available for download via the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.</p>



<h2>Chatbot</h2>

<h3>Artificial intelligence in healthcare</h3>

  <h4>Passion: Creating Technologies that advances the society </h4>
		
		In this project, my goal is to build  an interactive chatbot using natural language processing toolkits and the python programming language. What inspired me was the ongoing bias in Zimbabwe that people don’t need therapy and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6734988/">here is the link to the article</a>. There are also poor detection rates due to poor health systems caused by the increasingly bad socioeconomic environment(Zimbabwe). What's more sad is that the suicide rates are going up during this
		pandemic </p>
		
		<p>Background:</p>
		<p>I partnered with healthcare Zimbabwe because the goal is for the  chatbot tobe  filled with psychologist-designed guided self-help paths, mood/health tracking, relaxation techniques, and community support. 
		The ultimate goal is not to replace real doctors but to raise awareness on the issue. It is to offer a starting point for people who are not aware of mental health, provide a private, and stigma-free environment.
		The bot is meant to help users normalize talking about mental health by sending daily reminder notifications, educating users on mental health issues, tracking moods, offering nearby  resources e.g. clinics, psychiatrists, therapy.
		It also helps users narrow down the cause of their symptoms.</p>
